        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m <strong>Anoushka Amudhan</strong>, and I am a Data Science and Business Administration student at Northeastern, concentrating in Finance. I’m curious about the cybersecurity and finance industry, especially how data can be used to manage risk and improve decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve interned at <strong>LogicSource</strong>, where I worked on financial modeling, spend analysis, and data visualization to help clients cut costs. At <strong>Greyscale AI</strong>, I built and trained AI models using X-ray imaging to detect foreign materials in packaged food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I’m part of <strong>Northeastern Nakhraas</strong>. I’ve also taught ballet and coding. If you don't find me at the library, you can find me in the dance studio, either teaching or dancing. I also love to play classical guitar as well.
        </p>

        <h2>My Experience with Dance</h2>
        <p>
            I started my dance journey by teaching ballet at <strong>Tutu School</strong>, where I worked with young children to introduce them to the beauty of ballet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In high school, I was part of my school's dance team, where I performed styles like jazz, pom, and lyrical. I competed and performed in various school events, honing my technique and stage presence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, in college, I am a dancer on <strong>Northeastern Nakhraas</strong>, a competitive Garba Raas team. Performing Raas and Garba has allowed me to connect with my cultural roots while continuing my passion for dance.
        </p>
